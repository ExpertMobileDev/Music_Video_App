/*!
 onAll(callback)
 @discussion This singular API call can be used to gather all information from the player's API. Note: This will output a large amount of information and may degrade performance if it is used for an extended period of time.

/** @name Playback */

/*!
 onPlayAttempt(callback)
 @discussion Useful for QOE tracking - Triggered the instant a user attempts to play a file. This event fires before both the onPlay and onBeforePlay events.
 */
- (void)onPlayAttempt;

/*!
 onBeforePlay(callback)
 @discussion Fired just before the player begins playing. Unlike the onPlay event, the player will not have begun playing or buffering when triggered, which makes this the right moment to insert preroll ads using playAd().
 */

/*!
 onFirstFrame(callback)
 @discussion Useful for QOE tracking - Triggered by a video's first frame event (Or the instant an audio file begins playback). This event pinpoints when content playback begins.
 @param loadTime The amount of time (In milliseconds) it takes for the player to transition from a playAttempt to a firstFrame event. Use this to determine the period of time between a user pressing play and the same user viewing their content.
 */

/*!
 onPlay(callback)
 @discussion Fired when the player enters the 'playing' state.

 onReady(callback)
 @discussion Fired when the player has initialized in either Flash or HTML5 and is ready for playback.

 onBeforeComplete(callback)
 @discussion Fired just before the player completes playing. Unlike the onComplete event, the player will not have moved on to either showing the replay screen or advancing to the next playlistItem, which makes this the right moment to insert post-roll ads using playAd().

In addition, this will also provide reasons why this change happened, as well as information about how and why this change was triggered.
 @param mode The type of quality selection that has been enabled with the player. This will read auto when a user is relying on our automatic quality determination or manual when a user has selected a static quality.
