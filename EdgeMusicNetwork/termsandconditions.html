         <p>1.	The Edge Music Network Service. </p>
         <p>A.	Edge Music Network Inc. (“EMN,” “we” or “us”) is the provider of the Services, an online and mobile service provider that provides artists (directly and/or by their record label) with the opportunity to make their live in-concert and promotional videos and other content (individually and collectively, “Videos”) available and to connect with their fans.  The Service also enables its users to enjoy the Videos, share them with other users and engage in the Service’s various other features, activities and services. </p>
       <p>  B.	The Service offers multiple levels of functionality to its users: </p>
         <p>(i)  A free ad-based online service through which users can discover and search for artists, view Videos, participate in our mobile Service, and engage in integrated social activities on Facebook and other social networks, among other things.  The free Service includes advertisements both embedded in the Video player as well as on the page on which the Video player is contained.  Registered users may earn “points” redeemable for products by viewing Videos. </p>
         <p>(ii)  A “Premium” fee-based service, currently for $9.99 per month, through which users can have all of the free Service’s benefits, and which does not include ads embedded in the Video player but does include ads on the page containing the Video player.  Registered and paid Premium users can earn extra Points as designated on the particular Video.  Premium users also may be able to view exclusive, premium-only additional Videos not available with the free Services. </p>
         <p>C.	From time to time, we may offer trials of the Premium Service for a specified period without payment (a “Trial”). EMN reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability.  For some Trials, EMN will require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. At the end of such Trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the Premium Service on the first day following the end of the Trial, on a recurring monthly basis. By providing your payment details in conjunction with the Trial, you agree to this charge. If you do not want this charge, you must change your Subscription to the Free Service through your Account’s settings before the end of the Trial. </p>
