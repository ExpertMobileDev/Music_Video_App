        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Edge Music Network Inc. (“EMN,” “we” or “us”) is the provider of the Edge Music Network Service (the “Service”), aservice provider through various platforms, including, without limitation online and mobile.</p>
        <p>We value your privacy, and we want to help make your experience with the Service as safe and satisfying as possible. We have established this Privacy Policy to explain what types of Personal Information (as defined below) we collect from you, how that Personal Information is used, how it is disclosed to third parties, how you can review and modify information that you provide to us, and your preferences regarding our use or disclosure of such information.</p>
        
        <p>“Personal Information” is information that allows a person to directly identify or contact an individual, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, and information that we combine directly with such identifying information.</p>
        
        <p> "Additional Information" means any information that we collect on the Service other than Personal Information such as your musical preferences, favorite artists, titles you provide to your concert videos, etc. (Personal Information and Additional Information will be collectively referred to as "Information").  By visiting or using the Service, you consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>
        
        <p> This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the EMN Terms of Service.  Unless otherwise defined, terms used in this Policy have the same meanings as in the Terms of Service. As used in this Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within the United States or internationally. </p>
        
         <p>By using the Service, you agree to this Policy and expressly consent to the information practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Service or any features, activities or services offered through the Service.  This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of the Service or any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Service ceases or is suspended or terminated for any reason. </p>
        
        <h2>1.  COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p> User Registration--Users can view Videos and engage in certain other limited activities without registering for the Service.  However, registered users will be able to share and comment on Videos and engage in other additional activities, including earning of Points and securing Rewards.  If you elect to become a registered user by registering on the Service through any elegible platform, when you register EMN collects certain Personal Information, including your name, email address, IP address, birthday and a password that you select. </p>
        
         <p>In addition, each Premium Subscriber must provide his or her credit card information (which is stored by the credit card processor, not by EMN).   This Personal Information related to your billing information is used solely to administer your activities with the Service and to process your transactions including your purchase of subscriptions to the Service and EMN’s and our business partners’ other content, products and services. </p>
         <p>Site Features, Functions and Communications--The Service may offer you access to certain features or functions such as interactive, community and user-user relationship features, message boards, chat areas, profile pages and ratings. To participate in these features and functions, you may be asked to provide certain Information about yourself to allow you to use these features and functions and to personalize them.  For example, to personalize your user profile, you will have the opportunity to provide a profile image, your general location and a short description of yourself.  You also may be presented with opportunities to sign up to receive emails, newsletters or other communications from us regarding up-to-date information about the Service, and to publicize and promote certain artists, content, products and services offered by us or our business partners. When there is a separate sign-up for such communications, we may ask you for your contact information such as name and email address, and, we may ask for demographic and profile information. </p>
        <p> Contests, Sweepstakes and Surveys--Certain Service-related contests, sweepstakes and surveys may require a separate registration process in order to participate which may require the submission of both Personal Information and Additional Information (including your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, demographic or profile information, etc.).  The Information you provide will be used for the purpose of conducting the promotion (for example, to contact you if you have won), and you also may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special promotions or offers from our advertisers as a result of your use of the Service. </p>
        <p> Location Data--EMN offers location-based services such as suggesting the event you may currently be attending or nearby events and venues, as well as aggregating users’ submitted concert videos and plotting them on a “map” to create a time-synchronized viewing experience which may combine users’ submitted videos with each other and with official event footage.  If you use those services, EMN and our business partners may collect, use, and share precise data about your location, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or device (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device or information that may be used to approximate a location such as a cell ID or IP address).</p><p> Furthermore, this information may be combined with data regarding the time (such as matching the time and location at which you record a concert video) that we collect from you and other sources (such as, for example, Google Analytics, ComScore Beacon, Neilsen Video Census, Kaltura Video Player, Akamai Media Analytics and Edge Services, AddThis and Gigya). Location data may be used in the Service in a manner that personally identifies you with reference to concert videos that you provide to the Service.  Location data also may be used in an anonymous manner in a form that does not personally identify you to provide location-based content, products and services from EMN and our business partners. Your positioning settings and your use of the location services of other service providers may result in your device connecting to the servers of other service providers, which are not operated or controlled by EMN.  We recommend that you to check the privacy policies of such service providers to best understand how they handle and process your location data. </p>
        
          <h2>2.  ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION</h2>
        <p> Our Service, like many similar services, includes features that automatically collect Information from your browser on our server logs regarding your visits to the Service to assist us to keep track of your preferences, create a better user experience and address your particular interests and needs. </p>
         <p>The Service and/or third parties may use a variety of methods such as browser or Flash “cookies” (small data files containing information about you that is stored on your hard drive), server-side sessions, "embedded scripts," clear GIFs (also known as “web beacons”) and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect this information as you interact with the Service. The information that we collect with these automated methods may include, for example, your IP address, domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, cookie information, a unique device or user ID, browser type, system type, data regarding your location, and the “referring URL” (i.e., the page from which you navigated to the Service).  Cookies also enable us to track your interaction with the Service, the content and pages that you access, the amount of video watched, content that you search for on the Service, access times and length of viewing of videos, viral sharing statistics, advertising campaign tracking and other relevant statistics which help us target your interests to enhance your experience with the Service.  Some cookies are used to make your login to our Service easier (such as by recognizing your account credentials for sign in purposes), and to store references to your account credentials and session validators on your hard drive.  We also include clear GIFs in some of our email messages in order to learn whether the messages are delivered and opened. We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Service and our other services and systems, and to provide content, products and services that are tailored to you.  Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process.  However, we may associate the information obtained through these Tracking Technologies with your Personal Information in order to better customize your experience with the Service and provide tailored promotions and advertisements related to your specific interests.  If any information gathered through Tracking Technologies is combined with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, EMN uses information collected by passive means in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms.

We do not have access to, or control over, these cookies or other means of passive data collection. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties. We cannot control the activities of such third parties. </p>

You may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website, where you can learn more about its member companies’ practices and to opt out from the collection and use of information by its member companies.
